# Redistricting 


This project aims to tackle the redistricting problem and improve existing solution algorithms. Our approach combines advanced applied algebra with machine learning algorithms to produce practical solutions on large-scale datasets. The Master branch contains the current work. (Joint work with Ivan Gvozdanovic)
